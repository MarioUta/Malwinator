# Testing:

After testing, I decided to try and craft a trojan horse that must be run as administrator to work, disguised as an Antivirus app. The Icon should appear legit and when run it should not just open the virus itself, rather create an environment for the virus to wreak havoc

# Plans:
 a) Add specific paths, such as Desktop/Download in Windows Defender exclusion paths(success)
 b) Open up a process(a video for fun :D ), or show a popup, then restart the PC(success)
 c) Search for the virus path in order to manipulate it(success)
 d) Add virus to Startup and make executable hidden(success)
 e) Looks like an App (success)
